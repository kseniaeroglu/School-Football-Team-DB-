# School-Football-Team-DB-

I'm an assistanant coach at my sons school football team since January 2024. We have games every saturday exept for holidays and winter months. It has been a struggle to track player performance and manage match records and make decisions for upcoming games. I've created this database to store and analyse all this data efficiently and accurate.

With this SQL-data I'm able to:

Manage a real team
Track and improve player performance
Make data-based desicions
Prepare reports for teachers and parents
For example I can:

Keep a record of who is the capitan for this season
Find MVP (most valuable player) of the match and award this child
See how many goals each player scored during season
See who played in the last match as need this information to make a decision whos playing next week. We need to give each player of the team the opportunity to play. School football is all about having fun and get involved.
Find 3 players who played the most average time per game
Find players who never played a game
We can delete a player if he left the team
We can get full picture of the match results
This SQL database will make coaches life easier.
